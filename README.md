# 🔧 LeetSync - Automatic LeetCode to GitHub Sync

**Automatically sync your accepted LeetCode solutions to GitHub!**

LeetSync is a browser extension that monitors your LeetCode submissions and automatically commits accepted solutions to your GitHub repository, complete with proper organization, metadata, and commit messages.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Automatic Sync** - Solutions are pushed to GitHub the moment they're accepted
- 📁 **Smart Organization** - Files are organized by problem tags (arrays, strings, dynamic-programming, etc.)
- 📝 **Rich Metadata** - Each solution includes problem title, difficulty, date, tags, and LeetCode URL
- 🌍 **Multi-Language Support** - Supports Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more
- 🔒 **Secure & Private** - Your GitHub token is stored locally and never shared
- ⚡ **Zero Manual Work** - Set it up once and forget about it

### Method 2: Install from Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

*Extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store once published.*

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Create a new repository for your solutions
   gh repo create leetcode-solutions --public
   # or create it manually on GitHub
   ```

2. **Generate GitHub Personal Access Token**
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
   - Select "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name like "LeetSync Extension"
   - Select the `repo` scope (full control of private repositories)
   - Generate and copy the token

3. **Configure LeetSync**
   - Click the LeetSync extension icon
   - Fill in your details:
     - **GitHub Username**: your-github-username
     - **Repository Name**: leetcode-solutions (or whatever you named it)
     - **Personal Access Token**: paste your token here
   - Enable the toggle switch
   - Click "Save Configuration"

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Start Solving Problems**
   - Go to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/)
   - Solve any problem as usual
   - Submit your solution

2. **Automatic Sync**
   - When your solution is accepted, LeetSync automatically:
     - Extracts your code and problem metadata
     - Creates a properly formatted file
     - Commits and pushes to your GitHub repository
     - Shows a success notification

3. **Check Your Repository**
   - Your solutions will be organized like this:
   ```
   leetcode-solutions/
   ├── arrays/
   │   ├── two_sum.py
   │   └── best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.cpp
   ├── strings/
   │   ├── valid_palindrome.js
   │   └── longest_substring_without_repeating.py
   └── dynamic_programming/
       └── climbing_stairs.java
   ```

## 📄 File Format

Each synced solution includes:

```markdown
# Two Sum

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Date:** 12/25/2023
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
**Tags:** array, hash-table

## Solution

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
    return []
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle automatic syncing on/off
- **Repository Settings**: Change target repository
- **File Organization**: Solutions are automatically organized by problem tags

## 🛠️ Development

### File Structure
```
leetsync/
├── manifest.json          # Extension configuration
├── content.js             # Main logic for detecting submissions
├── popup.html             # Settings UI
├── popup.js               # Settings UI logic
├── background.js          # Service worker
└── icons/                 # Extension icons
    ├── icon16.png
    ├── icon32.png
    ├── icon48.png
    └── icon128.png
```

### How It Works

1. **Content Script Injection**: Runs on LeetCode problem pages
2. **Network Request Interception**: Monitors submission API calls
3. **DOM Observation**: Watches for "Accepted" status messages  
4. **Code Extraction**: Gets solution code from Monaco/CodeMirror editors
5. **GitHub API Integration**: Creates/updates files using GitHub REST API
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user notifications

### Key Technical Details

- Uses Manifest V3 for modern Chrome extension development
- Intercepts `fetch` requests to catch submission responses
- Uses `MutationObserver` to watch for DOM changes
- Leverages GitHub REST API for repository operations
- Stores configuration securely using Chrome's storage API

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Open a Pull Request

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Repository not found" error**
- Make sure the repository exists and the name is spelled correctly
- Verify your GitHub username is correct

**"Invalid token" error**  
- Ensure your Personal Access Token has `repo` permissions
- Check that the token hasn't expired

**Solutions not syncing**
- Make sure the extension is enabled (check the toggle switch)
- Verify you're on a LeetCode problem page (not the main dashboard)
- Check browser console for any error messages

**Code not extracted properly**
- LeetSync works best with the default LeetCode code editor
- Some browser extensions might interfere with code detection

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console (`F12` → Console) for error messages
- Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome/Chromium-based)
- Verify LeetCode hasn't changed their UI significantly
